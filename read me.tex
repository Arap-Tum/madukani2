To help you make your e-commerce site unique with the feature of adding items to a cart and sending the details to a service provider’s WhatsApp inbox, I suggest integrating WhatsApp's API or using a simple URL scheme that pre-populates the message in the WhatsApp chat window. This way, the feature can remain on the front-end without the need for server-side development.

Before we proceed, here are a couple of questions for clarification:

    Do you want the user to be able to review their cart items and confirm them before sending the WhatsApp message?
    Should the message include just product names and quantities, or would you like to add more details such as prices and total cost?
    Would you like this feature to be a button that appears dynamically after the user adds items to the cart?

Let me know so I can provide specific code and design guidance!

Got it! Here’s a complete plan and approach for implementing this feature:
Steps for Implementing the "Add to Cart" and WhatsApp Message Integration:

    Cart Review Section:
        Create a modal or a sidebar cart summary that displays the added items, showing images, names, quantities, prices, and the total cost.
        Provide an option for users to review and confirm their items.

    Dynamic Button:
        Implement a button that appears dynamically when items are added to the cart, allowing the user to send the information via WhatsApp.

    WhatsApp Integration:
        Use a mailto-like URL scheme for WhatsApp to send a pre-populated message when the user clicks the button.

Sample Code Implementation:

Here's a front-end code example to give you an idea:
Explanation:

    Cart Review: A div shows the cart items with images, quantities, and prices, including a total cost section.
    Dynamic Button: A button is included to send the cart data to WhatsApp.
    WhatsApp Integration: Clicking the button opens WhatsApp in a new tab, pre-filled with the cart details.
